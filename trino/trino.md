HDInsight on AKS is a modern, reliable, secure, and fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). HDInsight on AKS allows you to deploy popular Open-Source Analytics workloads like Apache Spark™, Apache Flink®️, and Trino without the overhead of managing and monitoring containers.

You can build end-to-end, petabyte-scale Big Data applications spanning streaming through Apache Flink, data engineering and machine learning using Apache Spark, and Trino's powerful query engine.

All these capabilities combined with HDInsight on AKS’s strong developer focus enables enterprises and digital natives with deep technical expertise to build and operate applications that are right fit for their needs. HDInsight on AKS allows developers to access all the rich configurations provided by open-source software and the extensibility to seamlessly include other ecosystem offerings. This offering empowers developers to test and tune their applications to extract the best performance at optimal cost.

**Trino** (formerly PrestoSQL) is an open-source distributed SQL query engine for federated and interactive analytics against heterogeneous data sources. It can query data at scale (gigabytes to petabytes) from multiple sources to enable enterprise-wide analytics.

Trino is used for a wide range of analytical use cases and is an excellent choice for interactive and ad-hoc querying.

Some of the key features that Trino offers -

- An adaptive multi-tenant system capable of concurrently running hundreds of memory, I/O, and CPU-intensive queries, and scaling to thousands of worker nodes while efficiently utilizing cluster resources.
- Extensible and federated design to reduce the complexity of integrating multiple systems.
- High performance, with several key related features and optimizations.
- Fully compatible with Hadoop ecosystem.
